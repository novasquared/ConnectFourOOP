Connect Four

This is an object oriented version of the game written in javascript. 

Player 1 and 2 need to select a color from the dropdown list and then 
click the Start Game button.

The two players alternate turns. On each turn, when a player clicks the top of 
a column, a piece is dropped until a player gets four-in-a-row (horiz, vert, or 
diag) or until the board is full (tie).
