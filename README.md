Connect Four

Player 1 and 2 need to select a color and then click the Start Game button.
The two players alternate turns. On each turn, a piece is dropped down a
column until a player gets four-in-a-row (horiz, vert, or diag) or until
board fills (tie)

This is an object oriented version of the game written in javascript.
