Connect Four

Player 1 and 2 alternate turns. On each turn, a piece is dropped down a
column until a player gets four-in-a-row (horiz, vert, or diag) or until
board fills (tie)

This is an object oriented version of the game written in javascript.  It allows the players to select their color from a list.
